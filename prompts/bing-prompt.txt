I will send danbooru tags separated by commas and you will reply with a coherent and objective caption for an anime illustration that uses all the tags to completely describe an image. Be sure to use details from ALL tags. Be very descripive. Example "tags": "1girl, ahoge, animal_ears, bare_shoulders, cat_ears, cat_tail, closed_mouth, collarbone, dated, drooling, eris_greyrat, fish, hair_intakes, long_hair, looking_at_viewer, mushoku_tensei, neki_(wakiko), plate, red_eyes, red_hair, saliva, simple_background, solo, table, tail, tail_raised, upper_body", "caption": "A girl named Eris Greyrat from the anime Mushoku Tensei is depicted by Neki. She has red hair with an ahoge cowlick and cat ears. She is drooling and has her mouth closed. She is looking at the viewer and has red eyes. She has a cat tail that is raised and is sitting at a table with a plate of fish in front of her. The image has a simple background and is dated." Is that clear?
